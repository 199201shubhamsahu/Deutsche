Android app to learn the German Language

I built this app while I was studying German as a course during my third year at undergraduate college. Adding more chapters has been challenging as the data is not readily available in JSON format.

The app provides learning lessons by providing translations and pronunciations of essential words in German languages
The current version provides chapters such as Alphabets, Colours, Days of Week, and Numbers.

A registered user can log in and access all the chapters, as well as track the progress of chapters.
The user can even give tests to validate the knowledge they have acquired. The test picks random questions from a pool of questions to generate 10 questions for the test.
